## üõ† SQL Queries

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Segmentation by Spend
```
SELECT 
    [Customer ID],
    SUM(Quantity * Price) AS TotalSpend
FROM YourTableName
WHERE [Customer ID] IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY [Customer ID]
ORDER BY TotalSpend DESC;

Purpose: Identify high-value customers based on total spend.
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Repeat Customers Count
``` sql

SELECT COUNT(*) AS RepeatCustomerCount
FROM (
    SELECT [Customer ID]
    FROM YourTableName
    WHERE [Customer ID] IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY [Customer ID]
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
) AS RepeatCustomers;

Purpose: Count customers who made more than one purchase, a simple measure of retention.
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Sales by Country
``` sql
SELECT 
    Country,
    SUM(Quantity * Price) AS TotalSales
FROM YourTableName
WHERE CustomerID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;

Purpose: Identify the top countries by total sales.
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Monthly Sales Trend
``` sql
SELECT 
    FORMAT(InvoiceDate, 'yyyy-MM') AS Month,
    SUM(Quantity * Price) AS TotalSales
FROM YourTableName
WHERE CustomerID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY FORMAT(InvoiceDate, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY Month;

Purpose: See how sales trend over time.
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Top 10 Products by Revenue
``` sql
SELECT TOP 10

üìä Key Insights

Top Spending Customers

High-value customers contribute significantly to revenue and should be prioritized for retention strategies.

Repeat Customers

Even in a limited dataset, identifying repeat buyers helps highlight customer loyalty.

Opportunities for Retention

If repeat customer numbers are low, businesses can implement targeted offers and follow-up campaigns.

Simplicity Works

Even basic SQL queries can produce meaningful business insights without overcomplication.
